## Deployment

To deploy the pipeline for the first time, you'll need a GitHub secret name `github-oauth-token` in your Secrets Manager and then you can deploy it using `cdk deploy`. After the first deploy, any change that you push to your Git Repository will update the Pipeline and execute.

This project also uses two SSM parameters: `/eks-cdk-pipelines/hostZoneId` (String) and `/eks-cdk-pipelines/zoneName` (String). You can use `parameters.sh` to interactively include your parameters.
